1. Overall it was a tough process for me because I had to go back to previous assignements to remember how to code certain things. For example, I had to remember how to make the code randomize when a key is pressed and I had to remember how to make the circles bounce off each other. Additionally, incorporating the if else statements were a bit tricky because I did not have much experience using them.
2. One thing that makes more sense now is making the circles bounce off of each other. You have to make p5 check the distance between the two circles, and if the distance is less than the radius, then they are touching and should bounce off each other at that point.
3. I am most proud of being able to fully complete the project. I am also proud of being able to combine all of the knowledge that we have accumulated during the assignemnts leading up to this project and create one final submission.
