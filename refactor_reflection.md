Reflection: This was a bit harder for me to do. I had to review that notes from the lesson to understand how to change the code. Nevertheless, I think I completed it properly. I am happy that I was able to figure it out, but it definetely took a bit of trial and error. Between changing the variable names and making the objects overlap, there were a lot of adjustments that needed to be made. I will continue working on this topic since I noticed I struggled a bit with it.
